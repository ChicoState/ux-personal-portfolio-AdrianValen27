# Adrian's UX Portfolio

Greetings, online stranger! I am a computer science major, I am a senior at Chico State, and I am originally from SoCal.

My interests include biking, cooking, video games, and coding.

After I finish my degree, I would love to work in Software Engineering, with a slight focus on High Performance Computing because I love optimizations and fast efficient code.
